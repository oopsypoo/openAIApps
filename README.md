**2023-11-07** First commit of this hobby-project. Using WPF, OpenAI API. 
On this date there was a couple of updates from the OpenAI community regarding GPT 4 Turbo. New to me so I thought I'd try it out and therefore I commited this _stuff_ to Github.
Two models available in the **GPT4 Turbo** family at this time:
1. gpt-4-1106-preview - works "_out of the box_" in my code
                        _The latest GPT-4 model with improved instruction following, JSON mode, reproducible outputs, parallel function calling, and more. Returns a maximum of 4,096 output tokens. This preview model is not yet suited for production traffic__
2. gpt-4-vision-preview - this can be interesting to try out.
                          _Ability to understand images, in addition to all other GPT-4 Turbo capabilties. Returns a maximum of 4,096 output tokens. This is a preview model version and not suited yet for production traffic_

**DALL-E**
DALL-E v3 - I will see if I can update to this version

**Assistant API**
Haven't tried yet. Can be interesting.

**TTS**
Will not update or do more here for the time being

**GPTs**
Somehing to look into in the future? See their quotes below:
_We launched a new feature called GPTs. GPTs combine instructions, data, and capabilities into a customized version of ChatGPT_
_In addition to the capabilities built by OpenAI such as DALLÂ·E or Advanced Data Analysis, GPTs can call developer-defined actions as well. GPTs let developers control a larger portion of experience. We purposefully architected plugins and actions very similarly, and it takes only a few minutes to turn an existing plugin into an action_
